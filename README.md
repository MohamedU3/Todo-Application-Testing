# Todo-App
This project is from "Manual testing" course on QAcart.com and to be used only for educational purposes. Huge thanks to my teacher Hatem Hatamlah for providing this free project for educational purposes.

## Installation
1-Extract the todo-application.zip and add the files to your compiler
2-Add a ".env" file and add this inside it:
MONGO_DB_URL=add_your_URL_here
TOKEN_SECRET=sahgjasbdasd
NOTE: I was using MongoDB to access the database and you can add your own URL by connecting mongodb to the project (follow MongoDB steps to connect to the database).
3-Use "yarn install" in the terminal to install the packages.
4-Use "yarn start:server" to run the database and use "yarn:start" to start the app locally.
5-For any additional commands check out the "package.json" code and go to the "scripts" section.

## About the app
This is a simple to do app where you can add your daily tasks, delete them and mark them as completed.It has 4 major modules/API's: Signup, Login, Todo page, New todo page.
## My role in this project
As a software tester I was required to do black box testing and to do functional and some non functional testing( like compatability testing) by following the Software Requirement Specification.MongoDB was used for controlling databases.I used different testing techniques like Equivalent Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis.Test cases and bug reports are listed in the "Todo Application Checklist" excel sheet.
